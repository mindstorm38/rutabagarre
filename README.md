A Python game made for a GameJam with the themes "fruits and vegetables" and "to fall asleep and wake up". We got the obligation to use Pygame and a 1024 x 768 window, so don't juge us please.


## What is it?
An awesome ~~realistic, SSBU-killer~~ local-multiplayer fighting game where the player embodies a farmer that can take control of plants to fight other players.
